                                oBrowser
                       --------------------------

1. PREREQUISITES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  To be able  to build oBrowser, you need  several software.
This build dependencies will change in the future to be smaller.

Mandatory to build the core
 - a bourne-like shell (like bash)
 - the GNU version of make
 - perl (this will be removed)
 - OCaml 3.11.0 and an associated C compiler

Not mandatory (optional examples)
 - Ocsigen to build and run the ocsigen-related examples
 - Menhir (and ocamllex)

2. GETTING STARTED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Just  type "make  tutorial", then  open tutorial/index.html  in your
favorite browser. Not all browsers are fully supported yet.
You can also open examples.html to run the examples.

  We have  tried our  best to make  this software compatible  with all
browsers, but  since it is still in  an early stage, you  may need the
last version of your favorite browser. By now, it has been tested on :

 - Mozilla Firefox 2 and 3 (beta)
 - Opera 9.5 (beta)     
 - Safari 3.1 for Windows and 3.2 for MacOSX
 - Konqueror 4
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 (beta)

The two later ones have  proven slower at running our JavaScript code,
we may be able  to profile our code better in the  future and make the
situation change

  Our main development platform is Mozilla Firefox 3, since the
firebug third-party extension enables the developper to inspect, check
and edit the DOM, CSS and JavaScript data structures live, which may
be a good tool to understand how your code interacts with the DOM too.
